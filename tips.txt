When "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx host is not allowed to connect to MySQL Server", do this:
--> Connect to mysql from bash
--> Check  SELECT host FROM mysql.user;
--> If you don't see the IP from above, enter the following cmds:
    . GRANT ALL ON db_name.* to 'db_username'@'xxx.xxx.xxx.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'db_rootpassword'
    . FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    . SELECT host FROM mysql.user;
--> You 'll be fine ;)
--> Otherwise, pray
